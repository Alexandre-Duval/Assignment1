# Dice Rolling Simulator

Program that rolls a 6 sided dice.

## How it works

- `roll_dice` will ask the user to roll the dice and generate a random number from 1 to 6 to simulate rolling a 6 sided dice.
- `keep_playing` will ask the user if they want to play the game again.
- `main` runs the main game loop.
